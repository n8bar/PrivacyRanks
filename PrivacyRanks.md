# Personal Privacy Ranks (10 Ranks)

## 0) [Consent Zombie](articles/individual/00.md)
**Core Move:** Accept that privacy is about power, context, and future risk - not secrecy.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Identify one personal risk you actually care about.  
**Daily Habit:** Question one consent prompt per day before accepting.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Low  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is passive awareness: they sense risk but defer action. Without moving up, vulnerability is already meaningful for everyday people and escalates fast for public-facing targets.  
**Boss Fight:** "I'm not important enough to be targeted."
**Examples:**
- Example: Lady Elowen knows data harvesting is real, but still taps "Accept All" to move on.

## 1) [Browser Squire](articles/individual/01.md)
**Core Move:** Leave Chrome and harden a privacy-respecting browser.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Set the new browser as default and configure basic protections.  
**Daily Habit:** Open links only in your default browser and keep extensions minimal.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Low  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is "defaults matter," and this is a high-payoff first move for almost everyone. Without it, broad passive tracking continues continuously, even for low-profile users.  
**Boss Fight:** "I need Chrome for one site" slowly becomes "I use Chrome for everything."
**Examples:**
- Example: Scout Liora opens every link in Brave, even when old habits call back.

## 2) Query Ghost
**Core Move:** Replace default search with a privacy-respecting engine.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Change search defaults on all browsers/devices.  
**Daily Habit:** Use bangs/shortcuts instead of falling back to surveillance search out of habit.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Low  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is intentional discovery: they care where queries go. This is still high payoff for the average person; without it, search history can leak interests, intent, and life patterns, with even higher stakes for high-profile users.  
**Boss Fight:** Convenience relapse when niche results feel better on old defaults.
**Examples:**
- Example: Seeker Vael now searches through DuckDuckGo by default instead of surveillance engines.

## 3) Permission Ranger
**Core Move:** Audit app permissions, ad IDs, telemetry, and background access.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Complete a full permission review on phone and desktop.  
**Daily Habit:** Deny first; grant only when a feature breaks and the request makes sense.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is permission skepticism: access must be earned. This is another high-payoff mainstream step; without it, location, camera, and microphone leaks can create immediate real-world risk.  
**Boss Fight:** Permission fatigue leading to auto-accept behavior.
**Examples:**
- Example: Huntress Brynn audits camera, mic, and location access on a routine.

## 4) Password Paladin
**Core Move:** Use a password manager + unique strong passwords.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Migrate top 20 critical accounts to unique generated passwords.  
**Daily Habit:** Generate; do not invent. Save; do not memorize.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is credential rigor: every account deserves its own secret. This is one of the highest-payoff steps for everyone; without it, one breach can cascade into many account takeovers.  
**Boss Fight:** Reused "temporary" passwords that become permanent.
**Examples:**
- Example: Paladin Garrick forges unique passwords in a manager for every realm.

## 5) MFA Sentinel
**Core Move:** Enable app-based 2FA and add hardware keys where possible.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Turn on TOTP for priority accounts and store backup codes securely.  
**Daily Habit:** Verify new account creation always includes 2FA setup.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is takeover readiness: passwords alone are never enough. This is still high payoff for nearly everyone; without it, phishing and SIM-swap paths keep account takeover risk high.  
**Boss Fight:** SMS fallback or no recovery plan.
**Examples:**
- Example: Guard Thorne secures backup codes before declaring any account protected.

## 6) Identity Artificer
**Core Move:** Use a private inbox and context-specific aliases.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Migrate key accounts and create separate aliases for core contexts.  
**Daily Habit:** Never reuse an alias across trust boundaries.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is identity segmentation: one leak should not expose the whole life graph. Payoff is moderate-to-high for most people, and very high for creators or professionals; without it, correlation across accounts becomes easy.  
**Boss Fight:** One alias leak deanonymizes multiple accounts at once.
**Examples:**
- Example: Artificer Vesper uses separate aliases for banking, shopping, and public signups.

## 7) Signal Adept
**Core Move:** Migrate core chats/calls to end-to-end encrypted apps.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Move inner-circle contacts to encrypted messaging and verify safety numbers when relevant.  
**Daily Habit:** Default to encrypted channels for personal coordination.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is communication minimization: sensitive talk belongs in protected channels. Payoff is moderate for average users but high for organizers, journalists, and executives; without it, metadata mapping remains powerful.  
**Boss Fight:** Drifting back to metadata-heavy platforms for "group convenience."
**Examples:**
- Example: Envoy Seris defaults to private channels for personal coordination.

## 8) Metadata Ninja
**Core Move:** Strip EXIF/docs metadata before sharing files.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Set up a repeatable metadata-removal workflow.  
**Daily Habit:** Clean files before upload, not after posting.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is "files are data exhaust," so sharing is preceded by cleanup. Payoff is moderate for most people and higher for public-facing users; without it, small metadata leaks can compound into doxxing-level exposure.  
**Boss Fight:** Location/time/device leakage from "harmless" photo or document shares.
**Examples:**
- Example: Whisperer Nym removes hidden document metadata before sharing any file.

## 9) High-Risk Operator
**Core Move:** Add encrypted DNS, VPN, Tor, and compartment boundaries as needed.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Define a threat model and select only the high-risk tools you actually need.  
**Daily Habit:** Use high-risk tools only in the contexts that justify them.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** High-Risk  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is operational security under real threat. This tier is for people facing capable adversaries; for high-value targets, skipping it can become critical as defenses drift and attackers adapt.  
**Boss Fight:** Tool obsession without process discipline, backups, or recovery planning.
**Examples:**
- Example: High Custodian Voren applies Tor and compartments only for high-risk workflows.
