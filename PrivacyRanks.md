# Privacy Staircase (16 Ranks + Rank 0)

## 0) Consent Zombie
**Core Move:** Accept that privacy is about power, context, and future risk - not secrecy.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Identify one personal risk you actually care about.  
**Daily Habit:** Question one consent prompt per day before accepting.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Low  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is passive awareness: they sense risk but defer action. Without moving up, vulnerability is already meaningful for everyday people and escalates fast for public-facing targets.  
**Boss Fight:** "I'm not important enough to be targeted."
- Example: Lady Elowen knows data harvesting is real, but still taps "Accept All" to move on.

## 1) Cookie Squire
**Core Move:** Abandon Chrome; switch to Firefox/Brave.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Set your new browser as default on desktop and mobile.  
**Daily Habit:** Open links only in your new default browser.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Low  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is "defaults matter," and this is a high-payoff first move for almost everyone. Without it, broad passive tracking continues continuously, even for low-profile users.  
**Boss Fight:** "I need Chrome for one site" slowly becomes "I use Chrome for everything."
- Example: Scout Liora opens every link in Brave, even when old habits call back.


## 2) Query Ghost
**Core Move:** Replace default search with a privacy-respecting engine.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Change search defaults on all browsers/devices.  
**Daily Habit:** Use bangs/shortcuts instead of falling back to surveillance search out of habit.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Low  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is intentional discovery: they care where queries go. This is still high payoff for the average person; without it, search history can leak interests, intent, and life patterns, with even higher stakes for high-profile users.  
**Boss Fight:** Convenience relapse when niche results feel better on old defaults.
- Example: Seeker Vael now searches through DuckDuckGo by default instead of surveillance engines.

## 3) Tracker Tinkerer
**Core Move:** Harden browser settings; add minimal privacy extensions.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Disable third-party cookies and unnecessary telemetry; install 1-2 trusted blockers. 
**Daily Habit:** Keep extension count lean; remove anything you do not actively use.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is surface-area discipline: fewer trackers, fewer plugins, fewer leaks. This remains high payoff for most people; without it, fingerprinting and extension abuse steadily increase exposure.  
**Boss Fight:** Extension overload that increases fingerprinting and attack surface.
- Example: Smith Quillan pruned extension clutter to reduce tracking and fingerprint collection. And then disabled unnecessary telemetry and third-party cookie sprawl.

## 4) Permission Ranger
**Core Move:** Audit app permissions, ad IDs, telemetry, background access.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Complete a full permission review on phone and desktop.  
**Daily Habit:** Deny first; grant only when a feature breaks and the request makes sense.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is permission skepticism: access must be earned. This is another high-payoff mainstream step; without it, location, camera, and microphone leaks can create immediate real-world risk.  
**Boss Fight:** Permission fatigue leading to auto-accept behavior.
- Example: Huntress Brynn audits camera, mic, and location access on a routine.

## 5) Password Paladin
**Core Move:** Use a password manager + unique strong passwords.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Migrate top 20 critical accounts to unique generated passwords.  
**Daily Habit:** Generate; do not invent. Save; do not memorize.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is credential rigor: every account deserves its own secret. This is one of the highest-payoff steps for everyone; without it, one breach can cascade into many account takeovers.  
**Boss Fight:** Reused "temporary" passwords that become permanent.
- Example: Paladin Garrick forges unique passwords in a manager for every realm.

## 6) MFA Sentinel
**Core Move:** Enable app-based 2FA everywhere; avoid SMS when possible.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Turn on TOTP for priority accounts and store backup codes securely.  
**Daily Habit:** Verify new account creation always includes 2FA setup.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Everyone  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is takeover readiness: passwords alone are never enough. This is still high payoff for nearly everyone; without it, phishing and SIM-swap paths keep account takeover risk high.  
**Boss Fight:** SIM-swap exposure on accounts still using SMS fallback.
- Example: Guard Thorne secures backup codes before declaring any account protected.

## 7) Metadata Ninja
**Core Move:** Strip EXIF/docs metadata before sharing files.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Set up a repeatable metadata-removal workflow.  
**Daily Habit:** Clean files before upload, not after posting.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is "files are data exhaust," so sharing is preceded by cleanup. Payoff is moderate for most people and higher for public-facing users; without it, small metadata leaks can compound into doxxing-level exposure.  
**Boss Fight:** Location/time/device leakage from "harmless" photo or document shares.
- Example: (Top pick) Whisperer Nym removes hidden document metadata before sharing any file.

## 8) Alias Artificer
**Core Move:** Use email aliases and masked identities by context.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Create separate aliases for banking, shopping, socials, newsletters, and public signups.  
**Daily Habit:** Never reuse an alias across trust boundaries.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is identity segmentation: one leak should not expose the whole life graph. Payoff is moderate-to-high for most people, and very high for creators or professionals; without it, correlation across accounts becomes easy.  
**Boss Fight:** One alias leak deanonymizes multiple accounts at once.
- Example: Artificer Vesper uses separate aliases for banking, shopping, and public signups.

## 9) Signal Courier
**Core Move:** Migrate core chats/calls to end-to-end encrypted apps.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Move your inner-circle contacts to encrypted messaging and verify safety numbers when relevant.  
**Daily Habit:** Default to encrypted channels for personal coordination.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is communication minimization: sensitive talk belongs in protected channels. Payoff is moderate for average users but high for organizers, journalists, and executives; without it, metadata mapping remains powerful.  
**Boss Fight:** Drifting back to metadata-heavy platforms for "group convenience."
- Example: Envoy Seris defaults to private channels for personal coordination.

## 10) Inbox Cipherling
**Core Move:** Move primary email to a privacy-focused provider.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Create the new mailbox and migrate your critical logins.  
**Daily Habit:** Use the private inbox first; treat old inbox as temporary forwarding only.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: Medium  
**Who should do this:** Most People  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is that inbox equals root identity. Payoff is moderate-to-high for everyone, but especially for people with many linked accounts; without it, email compromise can cascade broadly.  
**Boss Fight:** "Just this one login" tied to your legacy inbox forever.
- Example: Keeper Alira migrated critical accounts to a privacy-first inbox.

## 11) DNS Warlock
**Core Move:** Use encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT) with trusted resolvers.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Configure encrypted DNS on browser, OS, and home router where possible.  
**Daily Habit:** Periodically test that encrypted DNS is still active after updates.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** Targeted  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is network trust awareness: DNS is a privacy decision, not plumbing. For average users this is an optimization step; for higher-risk users it is more important. Without it, network observers keep strong visibility into intent.  
**Boss Fight:** Silent fallback to ISP DNS after network changes.
**Examples:**
- Example: Warlock Zeph configured encrypted DNS across devices and home network.

## 12) Tunnel Operator
**Core Move:** Use a vetted VPN strategically (not as magic invisibility).  
**Unlock Requirement:** Choose a trustworthy VPN and define when it is required vs optional.  
**Daily Habit:** Enable VPN on hostile networks (travel, public Wi-Fi, hotels).  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** Targeted  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is contextual protection: tunnel when risk is real. For most people this is situational rather than daily-critical; for travelers, activists, and executives it carries bigger payoff.  
**Boss Fight:** Thinking VPN equals anonymity while logged into identity-linked accounts.
- Example: Captain Mordain knows VPN helps transport privacy, not identity anonymity.

## 13) Key Custodian
**Core Move:** Adopt hardware security keys for critical accounts.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Register at least two hardware keys (primary + backup) on your most sensitive accounts.  
**Daily Habit:** Use hardware key prompts by default when offered.  
**Payoff:** ROI: Medium | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** Targeted  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is phishing resistance by design, not willpower. This is increasingly a high-profile step: invaluable for people with money, audience, or influence, while optional-but-good for average users.  
**Boss Fight:** Single-key setup with no recovery path.
- Example: Custodian Halric protects critical accounts with primary and backup hardware keys.

## 14) Pathfinder Wizard
**Core Move:** Use Tor for high-anonymity browsing and compartmented sessions.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Set up Tor Browser and understand safe usage constraints.  
**Daily Habit:** Reserve Tor for specific tasks that truly need unlinkability.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** High-Risk  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is operational anonymity: tools plus strict behavior. This is mostly for high-risk or specifically targeted users; most people do not need this daily, but mistakes here can fully collapse anonymity.  
**Boss Fight:** Cross-contamination by logging into real-name accounts inside anonymity sessions.
- Example: Pathfinder Kellan keeps anonymity sessions isolated from real-name logins.

## 15) Compartment Architect
**Core Move:** Separate personas/devices/browsers per threat model.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Define at least three compartments (e.g., legal identity, pseudonym, high-risk research).  
**Daily Habit:** Stay inside the correct compartment; no copy-paste crossover unless intentional.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** High-Risk  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is hard compartment boundaries: identity contexts must not mix. This is primarily for high-profile or high-threat users; without it, cross-context linkage can enable sustained targeting and pressure.  
**Boss Fight:** Convenience shortcuts that merge compartments over time.
- Example: Engineer Morwen enforces compartment boundaries even when convenience tempts shortcuts.

## 16) Sovereignty Archon
**Core Move:** Self-host key services, document your threat model, run regular privacy audits.  
**Unlock Requirement:** Write a one-page personal threat model and execute a quarterly privacy review checklist.  
**Daily Habit:** Treat privacy as ongoing operations, not a one-time setup.  
**Payoff:** ROI: High | Effort: High  
**Who should do this:** High-Risk  
**Rank Description:** Their attitude is continuous privacy operations under active threat modeling. This tier is for people facing capable adversaries; for high-value targets, skipping it can become critical as defenses drift and attackers adapt.  
**Boss Fight:** Tool obsession without process discipline, backups, or recovery planning.
- Example: High Custodian Voren self-hosts key services and governs privacy like a system.
