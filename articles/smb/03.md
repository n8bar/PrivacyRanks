# Rank 3: Order of the Kept Sigil

Rank: 3

## Who This Is For
This rank is for SMB owners, managers, and IT-support teams who need account security to be dependable, not optional. It serves mixed technical audiences, including leaders who approve risk decisions but may not manage identity systems day to day.

## What This Rank Means
Order of the Kept Sigil is identity trust discipline. At this rank, organizations stop treating passwords alone as sufficient control. Access is protected through stronger verification and clearer ownership, so account compromise becomes harder and recovery becomes faster.
For mixed-technical teams, this rank is valuable because it turns identity security into clear governance rather than scattered ad hoc settings.
When identity trust improves, other controls become easier to enforce because account ownership and approval paths are no longer ambiguous in practice.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Identity hardening reduces high-impact business risk:
- Account takeover through phishing and credential reuse
- Privilege abuse when admin access is weakly protected
- Fraud events triggered by compromised email and finance accounts
- Operational disruption from inconsistent access control practices
- Escalating response cost when recovery paths are unclear

Identity failures are often the fastest route to business damage.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Start with high-impact identity anchors:
- Identify critical accounts (email admin, finance tools, cloud admin)
- Confirm strong second-factor protection on those accounts
- Remove obvious shared or legacy admin access where possible
- Record account ownership and recovery contact path
- Decide who approves future elevated-access requests

This is a trust-baseline step, not a full IAM overhaul.

## Standard Implementation
Organizations at this rank typically mature trust controls by:
- Expanding strong authentication to all high-risk workflows
- Reducing standing admin access and improving role clarity
- Tightening joiner/leaver identity lifecycle timing
- Standardizing recovery procedures for key accounts
- Reviewing identity events for signs of drift or misuse

The result is fewer identity surprises during stressful events.
This rank also improves confidence during staff transitions, because access and recovery decisions are less dependent on one person remembering unwritten rules.

## High-Risk Implementation
Higher-risk organizations may add stronger phishing-resistant methods for privileged access and tighter controls around identity provider changes.

## Tooling Options
- Identity provider policy controls
- MFA methods appropriate to risk and user context
- Privileged access governance workflows
- Access review reporting from existing platforms

Choose methods that teams will actually use correctly and consistently.
The strongest setup is usually the one that is simple enough for broad adoption and strict enough for high-impact accounts.

## Common Mistakes
- Treating MFA as complete even when coverage is partial
- Allowing shared admin identities to persist
- Leaving recovery paths weak or undocumented
- Failing to align access changes with staff transitions

## Verification Checklist
- Critical accounts have strong second-factor protection
- Ownership is documented for privileged accounts
- Shared/legacy admin access is reduced
- Access request and approval path is defined
- Recovery procedures are documented and testable

## When To Move To Next Rank
- Identity controls are stable for core systems
- Account ownership and recovery are clear under pressure
- Leadership understands identity risk in business terms
- You are ready to tighten credential governance at scale

## Dependencies
Ranks 1 and 2 provide the base for this work. You need system visibility and enough patch discipline to avoid identity work being undermined by outdated infrastructure. Progress at this rank depends more on clarity and consistency than on buying new tools.
Leadership alignment is a key dependency: identity trust controls work best when ownership, approval authority, and recovery expectations are agreed in advance.

## Maintenance Cadence
Weekly: review privileged access changes and exceptions.  
Monthly: review MFA coverage and identity drift.  
Quarterly: test key recovery procedures and ownership accuracy.

## Incident Scenario
In the river fortress of Kelmarch, a clerk receives a convincing payroll message and enters credentials into a fake portal. The attacker reaches email and begins setting forward rules aimed at finance approvals. In the old model, the breach would spread before anyone noticed. Under Order of the Kept Sigil practices, strong second-factor controls on critical accounts and clear recovery ownership stop full escalation. The account is contained quickly, finance approvals are safeguarded, and business disruption stays limited.
The council logs the event, adjusts identity review cadence, and exits the incident with clearer ownership than it had before the attack organization-wide.
