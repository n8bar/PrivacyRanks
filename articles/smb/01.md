# Rank 1: Cartographers Guild

Track: SMB/MSP  
Rank: 1  
Previous: None

## Who This Is For
This rank is for SMB owners, managers, and MSP-supported teams who need clearer visibility before taking on heavier security decisions. It serves mixed technical audiences, including risk-accountable leaders with limited technical background.

## What This Rank Means
Cartographers Guild is a shift in operating mindset. Security starts with seeing the environment clearly: what systems exist, who owns them, and which ones matter most. At this rank, privacy and visibility are treated as business capabilities.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Better visibility reduces uncertainty-driven risk:
- Hidden assets that remain exposed because no one tracks them
- Stale privileged access that survives staff or vendor turnover
- Slower incident response due to unclear ownership
- Shadow systems holding business data outside normal oversight
- Leadership decisions made without a reliable operational map

The highest payoff is clarity. Later controls become faster, cheaper, and more accurate.
In practical terms, teams spend less time hunting for context during urgent moments. That time savings often matters as much as the direct security gain.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
A lightweight first pass creates momentum:
- Identify core systems (email, files, finance, customer systems)
- Identify who currently owns each one
- Capture known admin-capable accounts for those systems
- Store this baseline in one shared place
- Assign one owner for keeping it current

This is not a full audit. It is a practical baseline that makes future decisions less reactive.

## Standard Implementation
Organizations at this rank typically mature visibility in steady steps:
- Expand from hardware lists to identities, SaaS, and vendor access
- Tie ownership to business functions, not only technical roles
- Fold joiner/leaver updates into normal operations
- Review the map with risk and continuity context, not just IT status
- Use this map to guide priorities for upcoming hardening work

Teams often report less stress because handoffs and escalation paths become clearer.
This rank often improves budgeting conversations too: when leaders can see ownership and business impact clearly, security priorities become easier to justify and sequence.

## High-Risk Implementation
Higher-risk organizations may begin adding impact tiers and external exposure context so critical systems receive faster attention.

## Tooling Options
- Shared register (spreadsheet, wiki, or service inventory)
- Existing admin dashboards for identity and endpoint exports
- Basic ticketing workflows for ownership updates
- Advanced platforms can be evaluated later if complexity grows

At this rank, consistency matters more than tooling sophistication.
Simple systems that teams actually use will outperform complex systems nobody maintains.

## Common Mistakes
- Treating visibility as one-time documentation
- Framing inventory as "IT work" instead of business risk hygiene
- Tracking devices but not privileged identities
- Leaving ownership informal and dependent on memory

## Verification Checklist
- Core systems and owners are easy to identify
- Admin-capable accounts are visible for key systems
- One shared source of truth exists
- Ownership for updates is assigned
- The map is used in planning conversations

## When To Move To Next Rank
- Unknown systems and unknown owners are now exceptions
- Leadership can quickly identify where updates matter most
- Teams can connect incidents to named system owners
- Visibility is treated as an operational baseline

## Dependencies
No advanced tooling is required. The main dependency is organizational agreement that visibility supports continuity, security, and decision speed. Without that agreement, technical work becomes fragmented and hard to sustain.
For less-technical teams, plain language ownership labels help adoption. If people understand who owns what and why it matters, participation rises without heavy process overhead.

## Maintenance Cadence
Weekly: update ownership and system changes.  
Monthly: review the map with business-impact context.  
Quarterly: reassess critical system scope and priorities.
If your organization changes quickly, add a brief monthly ownership check with finance or operations so software spend and system ownership stay aligned.

## Incident Scenario
In the trade city of Halewatch, the Merchants' Council discovers fraudulent payment redirects after a supplier account is compromised. During response, no one can confirm who owns the affected integrations or which old admin credentials are still active from past contractors. This is a visibility failure before it is a tooling failure. After adopting Cartographers Guild discipline, the Merchants' Council now keeps a shared map of systems, owners, and privileged access. When a second incident struck months later, containment was faster because discovery no longer starts from confusion.
