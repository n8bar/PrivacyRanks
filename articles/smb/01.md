# Rank 1: Cartographers Guild

Track: SMB/MSP  
Rank: 1  
Previous: None  
Next: [Rank 2](02.md)

## Who This Is For
This rank is for SMB owners, office managers, and IT-support partners who do not yet have a reliable view of what systems exist. It is especially useful for low-technical teams that inherited mixed tools, old devices, and unclear account ownership.

## What This Rank Means
Cartographers Guild is the discipline of visibility. Your organization builds and maintains a plain, usable map of devices, users, admin accounts, software, cloud services, and critical data locations. Without this map, every security decision is partial guesswork.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
This rank reduces foundational risk:
- Unknown assets left unpatched and exposed
- Orphaned admin accounts retained after staff changes
- Shadow SaaS tools storing business data without controls
- Delayed incident response because no one knows system ownership
- Insurance and audit friction from incomplete asset records

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Create a starter inventory in one session:
- List all business-owned devices currently in use
- List all staff accounts with admin-level access
- List core SaaS systems (email, storage, finance, collaboration)
- Assign one owner for each system
- Record location of this inventory and who updates it

Use a shared spreadsheet first if needed. Precision can improve later.

## Standard Implementation
Operationalize the map:
- Track joiners/leavers and update accounts within one business day
- Add software inventory and version status for critical tools
- Tag assets by business function (finance, customer data, operations)
- Record recovery contacts and contract owners for vendors/MSPs
- Run monthly inventory review with accountable owner

The objective is living visibility, not perfect documentation.

## High-Risk Implementation
For regulated or frequently targeted organizations:
- Add data-flow mapping for sensitive workflows
- Classify assets by impact tier (high/medium/low business impact)
- Track external exposure (public services, remote access points)
- Require formal sign-off for new systems entering production
- Tie asset map to incident response playbooks

Higher-risk environments need stronger ownership and traceability.

## Tooling Options (Vendor-Neutral, Example Products)
- Shared inventory register (spreadsheet, wiki, CMDB)
- Endpoint management and discovery tools
- Identity directory exports
- Ticketing systems to track asset lifecycle updates

## Common Mistakes
- Building inventory once and never updating it
- Tracking hardware but not privileged accounts
- Excluding contractor/vendor access from inventory scope
- Making one person the only holder of system knowledge

## Verification Checklist
- All active devices are listed with owner and status
- All admin accounts are listed with named owner
- Core SaaS services are listed with business owner
- Joiner/leaver changes are reflected within one business day
- Monthly inventory review has a named accountable role

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You can answer "what do we have?" within minutes, not days
- You can identify owner and admin path for each core system
- Unknown or stale accounts are discovered and cleaned routinely
- You are ready to enforce a patch cadence against known assets

## Dependencies
No prior technical rank is required. You need leadership agreement that inventory ownership is an operational responsibility, not an optional documentation task.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: update joiner/leaver and asset changes.  
Weekly: validate admin-account ownership.  
Monthly: full inventory reconciliation review.

## Incident Scenario
A small clinic faces ransomware on one workstation. During response, the team discovers three unmanaged laptops and two old admin accounts nobody can attribute. Recovery drags because ownership is unclear. After implementing Cartographers Guild, every asset and admin path is mapped, and future incidents move from confusion to controlled response within hours instead of days.
