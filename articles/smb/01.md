# Rank 1: Cartographers Guild

Track: SMB/MSP

## Who This Is For
This rank is for SMB owners, managers, and MSP-supported teams who feel that systems have grown faster than visibility. It is especially relevant when technical fluency is mixed and no one person can confidently answer what assets, accounts, and services are truly in scope.

## What This Rank Means
Cartographers Guild is a mindset shift from assumptions to visibility. At this rank, organizations treat asset awareness as business clarity, not an IT side project. Teams begin seeing that security confidence comes from knowing what exists, who owns it, and what matters most.
This framing is useful for non-technical leaders because it connects directly to continuity, accountability, and decision speed. Visibility is not extra work layered on top of operations; it is a way to reduce wasted effort across operations.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
This rank reduces confusion-driven risk:
- Unseen assets that stay exposed because no one tracks them
- Stale privileged accounts that survive staff or vendor changes
- Slow incident response when ownership is unclear
- Risk concentration in shadow tools no one considers critical
- Leadership blind spots that make funding and prioritization reactive

The biggest payoff is reduced uncertainty. Better visibility makes every later control more effective.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
A light first pass is enough to create momentum:
- Identify core business systems (email, file storage, finance, customer systems)
- Identify who currently "owns" each one operationally
- Capture known admin-capable accounts for those systems
- Store this baseline in one shared place leadership can access
- Agree on a simple owner for keeping this map current

This is not about perfection. It is about creating a shared map so decisions stop being guesswork.

## Standard Implementation
Organizations at this rank typically mature the map in practical steps:
- Expand visibility beyond devices to include SaaS, identities, and vendor access
- Tie ownership to business functions, not just technical staff
- Build simple joiner/leaver updates into normal operating rhythm
- Review the map regularly in business terms: impact, ownership, recovery exposure
- Use the map to prioritize where hardening should happen next

The value is less firefighting and fewer surprises.
Teams often find this rank lowers stress because uncertainty drops. When ownership is visible, meetings become shorter, escalations are clearer, and security conversations move from blame to coordination.

## High-Risk Implementation
For most SMB readers at this stage, advanced risk mapping is optional. Teams facing regulatory pressure or frequent targeting can begin adding impact tiers and external exposure views.

## Tooling Options
- Shared spreadsheet/wiki for first-pass visibility
- Existing identity admin dashboards for account enumeration
- Endpoint and SaaS admin exports
- Example enterprise tools can be introduced later if complexity grows

Tools matter less than maintaining a shared, trusted source of truth.

## Common Mistakes
- Treating inventory as one-time documentation
- Framing visibility as "IT work" instead of business risk management
- Tracking hardware while ignoring privileged identities
- Keeping ownership informal and dependent on tribal knowledge

## Verification Checklist
- Leadership can name core systems and owners without searching
- Admin-capable accounts are visible for core systems
- One shared system map exists and is accessible
- Ownership for updates is assigned
- The map is referenced in planning, not just stored

## When To Move To Next Rank
- Asset and ownership visibility is stable enough to support patch decisions
- Unknown systems and unknown owners are now exceptions, not normal
- Teams can quickly identify where critical updates should land first
- Leadership sees visibility as an operational baseline

## Dependencies
No advanced tooling is required. The main dependency is cross-functional agreement that visibility is a business discipline. Without that agreement, technical efforts tend to fragment and stall.

## Maintenance Cadence
Weekly: refresh ownership changes and new system additions.  
Monthly: review the map with business context, not just technical status.  
Quarterly: reassess critical systems and impact tiers.

## Incident Scenario
A regional services firm experiences credential abuse in a cloud app. During response, no one can confirm who owns affected integrations or which admin accounts remain active from past contractors. Recovery takes days. After adopting Cartographers Guild practices, ownership and access paths are visible up front, and the next incident is contained quickly because discovery time drops from days to minutes.
