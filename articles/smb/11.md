# Rank 11: Scryhall Chronicle

Track: SMB/MSP  
Rank: 11  
Previous: [Rank 10](10.md)  
Next: [Rank 12](12.md)

## Who This Is For
This rank is for SMB and MSP-aligned teams that already run baseline controls and now need stronger confidence in detection. It fits leaders and operators who are less concerned with adding random tools and more concerned with knowing whether meaningful threats are seen in time.

## What This Rank Means
Scryhall Chronicle means an organization starts treating telemetry as operational intelligence. Logs are no longer just records to keep. They become signals used to detect account misuse, validate response decisions, and provide evidence when incidents need investigation.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
At this rank, detection maturity reduces costly blind spots:
- Late discovery of account compromise and privilege abuse
- High-impact incidents that spread before anyone notices
- Weak investigation quality due to missing or short-lived logs
- Leadership uncertainty during incidents because evidence is fragmented
- Compliance and insurer friction when monitoring cannot be demonstrated

The core payoff is earlier visibility and better decision quality under pressure.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
A practical starter move focuses on signal, not scale:
- Choose a central place to receive key security-relevant logs
- Connect identity, email admin, and endpoint alerts first
- Define a small set of high-confidence alerts (for example: impossible travel, MFA disable, repeated failed admin logins)
- Assign who reviews alerts and how escalation is triggered
- Validate one alert path end-to-end

This creates initial detection confidence without requiring full SIEM maturity.

## Standard Implementation
Organizations at this rank typically evolve from collection to usable detection:
- Expand visibility to include remote access, critical SaaS admin actions, and network signals
- Define severity tiers and expected response windows
- Tune noisy detections so alert fatigue does not erode trust
- Keep retention aligned to investigation and legal/insurance needs
- Use recurring reviews to align telemetry with current threat patterns

The practical target is dependable signal quality, not maximum log volume.

## High-Risk Implementation
Teams with higher exposure often deepen correlation and response discipline:
- Correlate identity, endpoint, and network patterns to reduce false confidence
- Add after-hours escalation paths for high-severity detections
- Protect critical logs against tampering
- Track detection performance trends (time-to-detect, escalation quality, noise ratio)

At higher risk levels, telemetry quality directly affects business resilience.

## Tooling Options
- Centralized logging and SIEM-style platforms
- Native cloud telemetry pipelines from identity/email/endpoint systems
- Alert routing integrated with ticketing or on-call workflows
- Example products may include Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, or Elastic

Tool selection should follow operating model, not the other way around.

## Common Mistakes
- Collecting logs without clear ownership or review expectations
- Expanding alerts too fast and drowning teams in noise
- Assuming retention defaults will be enough during real incidents
- Treating dashboards as proof of readiness without tested response paths

## Verification Checklist
- Key telemetry sources feed a central destination
- Alert ownership and escalation path are documented
- High-confidence alerts are tested end-to-end
- Retention policy supports investigation needs
- Signal quality reviews happen on a defined cadence

## When To Move To Next Rank
- Detection is reliable enough to support incident command decisions
- Alert noise is controlled and triage quality is stable
- Response discussions use evidence rather than assumptions
- Leadership can explain monitoring capability in business terms

## Dependencies
This rank depends on stable identity and access foundations from earlier ranks. Without those foundations, telemetry effort often becomes noisy and expensive while still missing critical context.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: triage high-severity detections and confirm escalation quality.  
Weekly: validate ingestion health and alert reliability.  
Monthly: tune detections and retire low-value noise.

## Incident Scenario
A multi-location company experiences mailbox compromise tied to contractor credential abuse. In the past, this would have been discovered after invoice fraud escalated. With Scryhall Chronicle-level practices, correlated signals flag unusual login context, MFA state change, and suspicious mailbox rules early. The response team contains access quickly and uses retained telemetry to scope impact with confidence.

## Standards Alignment
- NIST CSF: DE.CM and DE.AE for continuous monitoring and anomaly/event detection
- CIS Controls: Control 8 (audit log management) and Control 13 (network monitoring and defense)
- SOC 2: CC7 for monitoring, anomaly detection, and timely response evidence
