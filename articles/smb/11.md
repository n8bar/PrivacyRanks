# Rank 11: Scryhall Chronicle

Track: SMB/MSP  
Rank: 11  
Previous: [Rank 10](10.md)  
Next: [Rank 12](12.md)

## Who This Is For
This rank is for SMB and MSP-supported organizations that already have baseline controls and now need better detection confidence. It serves leaders and operators who need reliable evidence of security posture, not just assumptions that controls are working.

## What This Rank Means
Scryhall Chronicle marks a shift from collecting logs to operating with signal. Telemetry becomes part of decision quality: incidents are detected earlier, response paths become clearer, and post-incident reviews rely on evidence instead of guesswork.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Detection maturity at this rank reduces high-impact blind spots:
- Late discovery of account misuse and privilege abuse
- Incident spread caused by delayed triage and unclear alert ownership
- Investigation failures from missing or short-retention log data
- Operational confusion when cross-system events are not correlated
- Audit and insurer pressure when monitoring cannot be demonstrated

The strategic payoff is faster recognition of real risk with less uncertainty during response.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
A practical first move focuses on quality over volume:
- Route identity, email admin, and endpoint events to one central destination
- Define a small set of high-confidence detections
- Assign alert ownership and escalation expectation
- Validate one end-to-end detection path with a tabletop or controlled test
- Document where evidence will be retained for incident follow-up

This starter step builds confidence without forcing full SIEM complexity on day one.

## Standard Implementation
Organizations at this rank typically strengthen operating reliability by:
- Expanding telemetry sources across identity, endpoint, remote access, and key SaaS
- Defining severity tiers and escalation windows that align to business impact
- Tuning noisy detections so analysts and managers trust alerts
- Setting retention aligned to legal, insurance, and investigative needs
- Running recurring detection quality reviews tied to current threat patterns

The practical objective is not maximum data. It is high-confidence detection with sustainable operations.

## High-Risk Implementation
Higher-risk organizations often deepen this rank by correlating signals across identity, endpoint, and network planes, adding after-hours escalation routes, and tracking detection metrics such as time-to-detect and false-positive rate. The goal is resilient detection under pressure, not dashboard breadth.

## Tooling Options
- Centralized logging and SIEM-style platforms
- Native cloud telemetry pipelines from identity and endpoint stacks
- Alert routing integrated with ticketing and on-call workflows
- Example products may include Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, or Elastic

Select tools that fit staffing capacity and response model.

## Common Mistakes
- Collecting logs without clear review ownership
- Expanding detections too quickly and creating persistent alert fatigue
- Assuming retention defaults are enough for real investigations
- Confusing dashboard visibility with tested incident readiness

## Verification Checklist
- Priority telemetry feeds into one central destination
- Alert ownership and escalation path are documented
- High-confidence detections are tested end-to-end
- Retention supports expected investigation windows
- Detection quality reviews occur on a defined cadence

## When To Move To Next Rank
- Detection supports incident command decisions with usable evidence
- Alert noise is manageable and triage quality is stable
- Response discussions reference telemetry, not assumptions
- Leadership can explain monitoring maturity in operational terms

## Dependencies
This rank depends on earlier identity, access, and endpoint maturity. If those controls are unstable, telemetry volume increases while confidence remains low. Detection quality is strongest when foundational controls are consistent.
Leaders do not need to tune detections themselves, but they do need to ensure ownership, escalation authority, and review cadence are clear enough for the system to work under stress.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: triage high-severity detections and verify escalation quality.  
Weekly: review ingestion health and missed-signal risk.  
Monthly: tune rules, retire noisy alerts, and validate one response path.

## Incident Scenario
In the fortified port of Sable Quay, the Harbor Ledger Office notices nothing unusual until vendors report strange invoice redirects. Under the old model, the team would react late and argue over what happened. With Scryhall Chronicle practices in place, correlated signals expose an unusual login pattern, followed by MFA state change and suspicious mailbox rule creation. In real-world terms, this is a classic identity-to-email abuse chain. Because detections are owned and tested, containment starts quickly, evidence is preserved, and leadership can scope impact without chaos. The same event still occurs, but outcomes improve because visibility is operational, not accidental.

## Standards Alignment
- NIST CSF: DE.CM and DE.AE for continuous monitoring and anomaly/event detection
- CIS Controls: Control 8 (audit log management) and Control 13 (network monitoring and defense)
- SOC 2: CC7 for monitoring, anomaly detection, and timely response evidence
