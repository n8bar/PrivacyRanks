# Rank 2: Query Ghost

Track: Individual  
Rank: 2  
Previous: [Rank 1](01.md)  
Next: [Rank 3](03.md)

## Who This Is For
This rank is for people who already changed their browser default and are ready for the next high-payoff setting: search behavior. It fits everyday users who want less profiling without giving up speed. It also fits people who often search sensitive topics, purchases, health questions, or personal plans.

## What This Rank Means
Query Ghost means your searches stop feeding the largest tracking pipelines by default. You choose a privacy-respecting search engine and keep it as your normal path. This rank works because search history reveals interests, intent, timing, and often identity clues.
For many people, this is the second major default change that compounds earlier progress. You are not trying to become invisible. You are reducing how much of your intent is automatically harvested.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Shifting search defaults reduces several common exposures:
- Long-term search profiling used for ad targeting and behavior inference
- Data linking between query history and account identity
- Sensitive intent leakage through routine searches
- Increased scam targeting based on recent interests
- Re-identification risk when search trails combine with other data

Search feels temporary, but its metadata is persistent and valuable.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Do one search-default reset session:
- Choose a privacy-respecting default engine (for example, DuckDuckGo or Startpage)
- Set it as default in your browser settings
- Repeat on your phone browser
- Test your address bar behavior to confirm search routing is correct
- Remove old search-engine shortcuts that auto-send to tracking-heavy engines

The goal is not zero friction. The goal is a concrete default that works in normal daily use.

## Standard Implementation
Make the new search path durable:
- Keep the same search default across desktop and mobile
- Learn one or two site shortcuts so convenience does not pull you back
- Use signed-in search accounts only when there is a clear benefit
- Avoid mixing sensitive and casual searches in one logged identity context
- Re-check defaults after major browser updates

The more consistent the path, the less likely you are to relapse under time pressure.
If convenience is a concern, keep a tiny list of intentional exceptions. That keeps you in control while still allowing edge-case workflows.

## High-Risk Implementation
If you believe you are high-risk, prioritize ranking up quickly so stronger protections are in place sooner.

## Tooling Options
- Privacy-respecting search engines (DuckDuckGo, Startpage)
- Browser keyword shortcuts for fast site-specific search
- Private browsing profiles for context separation
- Mobile browser settings to align search defaults with desktop

Choose options that reduce habit drift, not just options that look advanced.

## Common Mistakes
- Changing search on desktop but forgetting mobile
- Keeping old engine shortcuts that trigger by habit
- Signing into search-related accounts by default when not needed
- Assuming one settings change stays fixed forever

## Verification Checklist
- Default search is changed on all primary devices
- Address-bar queries route to your new search default
- Old shortcuts that bypass your default are removed
- You can perform common tasks without reverting
- You have used the new path consistently for two weeks

## When To Move To Next Rank
- Relapse to old search defaults is uncommon
- You can explain why search history has privacy impact
- Your default path is stable on desktop and mobile
- You are ready to reduce app-level over-collection next

## Dependencies
Rank 1 helps because your browser is already under control, but it is not a hard requirement. You need one setup window and the willingness to retrain a small habit loop. If a specific feature only works best on your old engine, use it as a targeted exception, not your default.
This rank succeeds when you reduce automatic drift. Small reminders, such as checking the search icon in your address bar, can reinforce the behavior until it becomes natural.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: use your chosen search default for ordinary queries.  
Monthly: review shortcuts and reset any drifted settings.  
Quarterly: reassess whether your search path still matches your risk tolerance.

## Incident Scenario
In the hill city of Thornmere, a student named Risa starts researching debt help, job changes, and housing moves. She searches everything through her old default engine while signed into multiple services. Within days, she sees eerily specific ads and scam-like offers tied to her exact worries. The issue is not one dramatic breach. It is profile buildup from ordinary queries. After moving to Rank 2 habits, she changes search defaults on phone and laptop, removes old shortcuts, and keeps sensitive planning out of identity-linked search sessions. Months later, her search experience feels quieter and less manipulative.
When she compares her workflow, she notices nothing became slower. The only real change is that fewer systems know her plans before she acts on them.
