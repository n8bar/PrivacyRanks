# Rank 0: Consent Zombie

Track: Individual  
Rank: 0  
Previous: None  
Next: [Rank 1](01.md)

## Who This Is For
This rank is for people who know privacy matters but have not started yet. It fits students, parents, workers, creators, and freelancers who feel busy, unsure, or not technical enough. It also fits people who think threats only happen to famous people.

## What This Rank Means
Consent Zombie means awareness without action. You see prompts, warnings, and permissions, but still click through fast. The goal at this rank is simple: break autopilot and build one repeatable habit that gives you more control.
Think of this rank as the doorway to the entire ladder. You are not judged on advanced tools here. You are judged on whether you can pause, decide, and follow through on one small protective action.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Moving out of this rank reduces common risks that build over time:
- Data broker profiling from broad tracking consent
- Phishing success from rushed trust decisions
- Account weakness from ignored setup and recovery options
- Exposure of routine behavior patterns through small data leaks
- Reputation or safety harm when separate data points get combined

These threats are common and often quiet. The earlier you interrupt autopilot, the more future risk you avoid.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Do one focused reset session:
- Pick one risk you care about most (scams, account theft, stalking, doxxing)
- Review app permissions and remove one that is clearly unnecessary
- Reject non-essential tracking prompts in your browser
- Turn off one ad-personalization setting
- Write one personal rule: "I pause before I accept"

This is a small win by design. The point is to prove that privacy can be practical now.
At this stage, visible progress matters more than perfect coverage. One clear action today is better than a long plan you never start.

## Standard Implementation
Turn your one-time change into a weekly routine:
- Run a 10-minute privacy check once a week
- Review five recent prompts and reject unnecessary access
- Remove one unused app, extension, or account connection
- Review one account security page and clean up old recovery paths
- Keep a short note of what changed and why

You are building judgment, not chasing perfection.

## High-Risk Implementation
If you believe you are high-risk, prioritize ranking up quickly so your core protections improve sooner.

## Tooling Options
- Built-in privacy dashboards on iOS/Android
- Privacy-respecting browsers like Firefox or Brave
- One trusted blocker, such as uBlock Origin
- A simple notes app for your weekly review log

Keep the tool stack small and clear.

## Common Mistakes
- Believing "nothing to hide" means "nothing to lose"
- Changing settings once and never checking again
- Accepting access requests because they feel urgent
- Reading about privacy but not changing defaults

## Verification Checklist
- You can name one privacy risk in plain language
- You removed at least one unnecessary permission
- You changed at least one tracking-related default
- You used your pause rule at least three times this week
- You set a recurring weekly review slot

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You pause before consent prompts most of the time
- You can explain two changes you made and why
- You complete weekly reviews for two straight weeks
- You are ready to change and keep a new browser default

## Dependencies
No technical background is needed. You only need attention and one short weekly time block. If your schedule is tight, keep this rank narrow and steady instead of trying to overhaul everything at once.
If friends or coworkers are also beginning, compare one small change each week. Shared momentum makes this rank easier to sustain.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: pause before high-impact consent clicks.  
Weekly: run a 10-minute prompt and permission review.  
Quarterly: revisit your top risk and update your personal rule.

## Incident Scenario
In the river city of Brighthollow, a courier named Nella runs her small craft shop from a phone and laptop. One evening she receives a "merchant security update" message marked urgent. She clicks fast, grants access, and moves on. By dawn, fake invoices are sent from her mailbox to real customers. In modern terms, this is a classic rushed-consent compromise. Nella recovers, but only after painful cleanup. She then adopts Rank 0 habits: pause rule, weekly review, and fewer blind permissions. When the next urgent prompt arrives, she stops, verifies, and declines. The attack fails because autopilot is gone.
