# Rank 0: Consent Zombie

Track: Individual  
Rank: 0  
Previous: None

## Who This Is For
This rank is for everyday people who know privacy matters but feel stuck, busy, or unsure where to start. It fits students, parents, workers, and creators who want less risk without becoming technical experts. It also fits people who keep telling themselves they will deal with privacy later.

## What This Rank Means
Consent Zombie means you are aware of risk but still operating on autopilot. You click through prompts, keep default settings, and postpone decisions. The purpose of this rank is simple: move from passive clicking to intentional choices, one small action at a time.
This rank is less about fear and more about agency. When you interrupt autopilot, you regain control over how much access you grant and how much data you leak by default.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Leaving this rank starts reducing common, low-visibility risks that build over time:
- Data broker profiling from repeated consent clicks and tracking settings
- Phishing success caused by rushed trust decisions
- Account exposure from weak setup and forgotten recovery paths
- Oversharing of behavior patterns that reveal routines and relationships
- Reputation and safety risk when small data points get combined by strangers

These are not rare edge cases. They are ordinary risks that compound quietly.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Run one focused starter session:
- Pick one personal risk you care about most (scams, account theft, stalking, doxxing, reputation damage)
- Review your phone app permissions and remove one that is clearly unnecessary
- Review browser privacy prompts from the last few days and reject non-essential tracking
- Turn off one non-essential personalization setting tied to ad targeting
- Write one personal rule: "I pause before I accept"

This is intentionally small. The goal is to prove to yourself that change is possible now, not after a full research project.

## Standard Implementation
Turn the first step into a steady habit:
- Keep a 10-minute weekly privacy check-in on your calendar
- Review five recent prompts/permissions each week and reject what is not needed
- Remove one unused app, extension, or account connection each week
- Check one account security page each week and clean up old recovery options
- Keep a short note of settings you changed and why

Progress at this rank is about consistency, not complexity.

## High-Risk Implementation
For most readers at this stage, skip high-risk tactics. Focus on building the core habit first.

## Tooling Options
- Device privacy dashboards on iOS and Android
- Privacy-respecting browsers such as Firefox or Brave
- A single trusted blocker such as uBlock Origin
- Any notes or checklist app you already use

Use tools to support decisions, not replace them.

## Common Mistakes
- Saying "I have nothing to hide" and stopping there
- Making one change once, then never revisiting it
- Accepting every permission because reading feels annoying
- Mistaking privacy content consumption for real implementation

## Verification Checklist
- You can clearly name one privacy risk you want to reduce
- You removed at least one unnecessary permission
- You changed at least one tracking-related default
- You followed your pause rule at least three times this week
- You scheduled a recurring weekly review

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You pause before consent decisions without forcing yourself
- You can explain at least two changes you made and why
- You complete a weekly review for two consecutive weeks
- You are ready to set and keep a new default browser

## Dependencies
No technical background is required. The only real dependency is attention. If time is scarce, protect one short weekly slot and treat it like an appointment. Early privacy improvement is mostly behavior change, not tool mastery.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: pause before high-impact consent clicks.  
Weekly: 10-minute review of permissions and prompts.  
Quarterly: revisit your top risk and update your personal rule.

## Incident Scenario
A freelancer clicks through a "security update" prompt inside a fake lookalike login page. The attacker gains mailbox access, then sends fraudulent invoices to clients. Recovery is painful and public. Afterward, the freelancer adopts Rank 0 habits: pause rule, permission review, and weekly account checks. The next phishing attempt fails because there is finally a decision step between urgency and action.
