# Rank 0: Consent Zombie

Track: Individual  
Rank: 0

## Who This Is For
This rank is for people who know privacy matters but still run on defaults. It fits busy workers, students, creators, and parents who feel they do not have time to learn security basics. It also fits people who assume they are too ordinary to be targeted.

## What This Rank Means
Consent Zombie means awareness without action. You see consent prompts, tracking popups, and account warnings, but click through to keep moving. The goal of this rank is not technical mastery. The goal is to shift mindset from passive acceptance to intentional choice.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
Moving out of this rank reduces broad, everyday exposure:
- Data broker profiling from repeated consent clicks
- Phishing success caused by autopilot trust behavior
- Account recovery abuse due to weak setup habits
- Oversharing patterns that expose routines and relationships
- Long-term risk from public data aggregation you did not notice

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Pick one account and one device, then run a focused reset:
- Choose one personal risk you care about (account theft, doxxing, scams, stalking, reputation damage)
- Review browser and phone privacy prompts from the last week
- Revoke one unnecessary app permission (camera, mic, contacts, or location)
- Turn off one non-essential personalization or ad-tracking setting
- Write a one-line rule: "I do not click Accept All without reading purpose"

This small reset is enough to break autopilot and create a habit loop.

## Standard Implementation
Build a repeatable weekly routine:
- Once per week, review five recent prompts/permissions and reject unnecessary ones
- Keep a short "privacy decisions" note in your phone for recurring choices
- Check one account security page each week and remove legacy recovery options
- Remove one unused app or extension each week
- Use a default-deny mindset unless a feature clearly requires access

The standard path is about consistency, not complexity.

## High-Risk Implementation
If you are public-facing or exposed to harassment, tighten faster:
- Remove personal data from public profiles and old bios
- Disable location-sharing defaults across social apps
- Use separate contact channels for public vs private communication
- Add checklists before posting media or travel updates
- Move sensitive conversations to encrypted channels early

High-risk users should treat "habit drift" as an active threat.

## Tooling Options (Vendor-Neutral, Example Products)
- Device privacy dashboards (iOS/Android permissions center)
- Browser privacy controls (Firefox, Brave)
- Consent managers and tracker blockers (uBlock Origin as an example)
- Personal notes/checklist apps for decision tracking

## Common Mistakes
- Believing "nothing to hide" means "nothing to lose"
- Setting one privacy control once, then never revisiting it
- Letting convenience exceptions become permanent defaults
- Equating awareness content consumption with actual risk reduction

## Verification Checklist
- You can name one personal privacy risk in plain language
- You rejected at least three unnecessary prompts this week
- You revoked at least one unnecessary app permission
- You changed at least one tracking-related default
- You documented a personal "acceptance rule" you can follow

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You consistently pause before consent prompts
- You can explain why at least two settings were changed
- You run a weekly 10-minute privacy review without reminders
- You are ready to make a default-browser decision and stick to it

## Dependencies
No technical dependencies are required. The only prerequisite is behavioral commitment. If time is limited, block a fixed 15-minute weekly slot so this rank does not remain conceptual.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: one pause before high-impact clicks.  
Weekly: 10-minute review of prompts, permissions, and one account setting.  
Quarterly: revisit your top risk and update your rule.

## Incident Scenario
Mara runs a small online shop and clicks through an urgent "policy update" email without checking sender details. The link requests full mailbox access, which she grants. Two days later, fake invoice messages go out from her account. Recovery starts when she revokes third-party app access, rotates credentials, and documents a new pre-click rule: no consent or grant action without verifying sender, scope, and reason. The lesson is direct: autopilot is a vulnerability multiplier.
