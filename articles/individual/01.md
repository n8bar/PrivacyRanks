## Who This Is For
This rank is for users ready to make one concrete default change: browser choice and baseline hardening. It is useful for non-technical people, remote workers, students, and creators who spend most of their digital life inside a browser.

## What This Rank Means
Browser Squire means you stop using surveillance-friendly defaults and intentionally choose a privacy-respecting browser. You also apply minimal hardening so your default behavior reduces passive tracking without requiring constant manual effort.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
This rank materially cuts broad tracking exposure:
- Cross-site tracking through default cookie behavior
- Telemetry-heavy default browser data collection
- Fingerprinting amplification from extension clutter
- Session leakage risks from weak browser hygiene
- Habit relapse into older browser ecosystems

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Complete a one-session baseline:
- Choose and install one privacy-respecting browser (example: Firefox or Brave)
- Set it as default on your main device
- Disable third-party cookies and unnecessary telemetry options
- Install one trusted blocker only (avoid extension pileup)
- Import bookmarks, then remove old browser from taskbar/dock to reduce relapse

This gives immediate payoff with low technical overhead.

## Standard Implementation
Make the change resilient:
- Set the same browser default on all personal devices
- Use separate profiles for personal and work contexts when needed
- Keep extension count lean and audited monthly
- Configure secure DNS in-browser if available
- Turn on auto-update and verify it is active

The standard target is stable defaults, not constant tuning.

## High-Risk Implementation
If your profile attracts targeted attention:
- Create dedicated browser profiles by risk context
- Disable link preloading and risky convenience features
- Use hardened settings for media permissions and notifications
- Keep social and sensitive workflows in separate profiles
- Pair browser isolation with stricter posting discipline

High-risk users should optimize for compartment integrity over convenience.

## Tooling Options (Vendor-Neutral, Example Products)
- Privacy-respecting browsers (Firefox, Brave)
- Content blocking extensions (uBlock Origin as an example)
- Cookie/container isolation features
- Profile-based browser separation

## Common Mistakes
- Moving browsers but keeping old default active on phone
- Installing many privacy extensions that increase fingerprint uniqueness
- Keeping telemetry-heavy defaults enabled after migration
- Falling back to old browser for "just one site" until it becomes normal

## Verification Checklist
- New browser is default on desktop and mobile
- Third-party cookies are disabled
- Only one to two trusted extensions are installed
- Old browser is no longer pinned in daily workflow
- Auto-updates are enabled and verified

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You have used the new browser as default for at least two weeks
- Relapse to old browser is rare and intentional, not automatic
- You can explain your key browser privacy settings
- You are ready to change default search behavior next

## Dependencies
Rank 0 mindset shift helps, but this rank can start independently. You need admin access on your own devices and a short migration window for bookmarks/password autofill behavior.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: stay in the default browser path.  
Monthly: extension and settings review.  
Quarterly: verify defaults on all devices after OS updates.

## Incident Scenario
Jon migrated to a privacy-focused browser on desktop but left his phone on old defaults. Most of his real-world browsing still happened on mobile, so tracking remained largely unchanged. He corrected by setting mobile default browser, syncing key settings, and removing old browser shortcuts. His exposure dropped because behavior finally matched policy across devices.
