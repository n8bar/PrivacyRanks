## Who This Is For
This rank is for people ready to make their first strong default change. It fits users who spend most of their online life in a browser and want a practical privacy upgrade without learning advanced security tools. If you want a high-payoff move with low friction, this rank is for you.

## What This Rank Means
Browser Squire means you stop treating browser choice as neutral. You pick a privacy-respecting browser, make it your default, and apply a few basic protections that reduce passive tracking. This rank is about building safer defaults so you rely less on willpower.
It is one of the most practical rank-ups because most online behavior starts in a browser. Change the starting point, and many downstream privacy outcomes improve without additional effort.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
This rank lowers several high-frequency risks:
- Cross-site tracking through permissive cookie defaults
- Excess data collection from telemetry-heavy browser settings
- Exposure from extension overload and unnecessary permissions
- Habit relapse into older browser ecosystems that prioritize profiling
- Session and identity leakage from weak browser hygiene

For most people, this is one of the highest payoff upgrades in the whole ladder.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Complete one migration session:
- Install a privacy-respecting browser (for example, Firefox or Brave)
- Make it your default browser
- Disable third-party cookies and review telemetry options
- Install only one trusted blocker
- Move bookmarks and remove old browser shortcuts from your main workflow

The point is to make the safe path the easy path.

## Standard Implementation
Make the change durable across your routine:
- Apply the same default-browser decision on phone and desktop
- Keep extension count intentionally low and review monthly
- Use profile separation when personal and work behavior should stay distinct
- Keep browser auto-updates enabled
- Recheck critical settings after major browser or OS updates

This rank succeeds when your behavior follows your policy automatically.
If you share devices or switch contexts often, profile boundaries become even more valuable because they reduce accidental crossover between personal, work, and public activity.

## High-Risk Implementation
Most readers can skip advanced hardening at this rank. Public-facing or targeted users may add stricter profile isolation once baseline defaults are stable.

## Tooling Options
- Privacy-respecting browsers (Firefox, Brave)
- Lightweight blocking tools (uBlock Origin as an example)
- Built-in profile/container separation features
- Sync features to carry settings across devices

Choose fewer tools and use them well.
When in doubt, prefer native browser settings before installing another extension. Fewer moving parts usually means fewer surprises.

## Common Mistakes
- Changing desktop defaults but leaving mobile unchanged
- Installing many privacy extensions that increase fingerprint uniqueness
- Keeping legacy browser shortcuts and drifting back by habit
- Treating setup as done forever instead of reviewing after updates

## Verification Checklist
- Default browser is changed on both desktop and mobile
- Third-party cookies are disabled
- Extension count is minimal and intentional
- Old browser is no longer in daily quick-access path
- Auto-update is enabled and verified

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You consistently use the new browser for daily activity
- Relapses are rare and deliberate, not automatic
- You can explain your key browser privacy settings in plain language
- You are ready to lock in a privacy-respecting default search engine

## Dependencies
Rank 0 mindset helps, but no deep technical skill is required. You need one setup window and willingness to tolerate minor convenience tradeoffs while habits reset.
If your workflow depends on a legacy site, keep a controlled exception path instead of reverting your whole default. The goal is stable privacy defaults with intentional exceptions, not all-or-nothing purity.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: stay on your chosen default browser path.  
Monthly: review extensions and key settings.  
Quarterly: verify defaults across all devices after updates.

## Incident Scenario
A consultant moved to a safer browser on laptop but kept the old default on phone, where most real browsing happened. Tracking exposure stayed nearly the same. Once phone defaults were corrected and old shortcuts removed, exposure dropped quickly. The lesson: privacy gains only count when defaults match actual behavior.
