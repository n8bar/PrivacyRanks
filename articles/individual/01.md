# Rank 1: Browser Squire

## Who This Is For
This rank is for people ready to make one practical privacy upgrade with high payoff. It fits users who spend most of their online time in a browser and want better protection without becoming security experts.

## What This Rank Means
Browser Squire means browser choice becomes intentional. You choose a privacy-respecting browser, make it your daily default, and apply a few baseline settings that reduce passive tracking. This rank works because defaults shape behavior.

## Threats This Rank Reduces
This rank cuts several high-frequency exposures:
- Cross-site tracking from permissive cookie settings
- Extra data collection from default telemetry behavior
- Fingerprinting risk from extension overload
- Habit drift back into tracking-heavy browser ecosystems
- Ongoing privacy leakage caused by weak daily defaults

For most readers, this is one of the strongest early rank-ups available.
Because browsers are where links open, forms are filled, and searches begin, default behavior at this layer affects almost everything else you do online.

## Minimum Viable Implementation (30-60 Minutes)
Run a focused browser migration:
- Install a privacy-respecting browser (for example, Firefox or Brave)
- Set it as default
- Disable third-party cookies and review telemetry settings
- Install one trusted blocker
- Remove old browser shortcuts from your main daily path

The purpose is simple: make your safer path the easiest path.

## Standard Implementation
Make the change stick across real life:
- Apply the same default-browser choice on phone and desktop
- Keep extension count minimal and review monthly
- Use separate profiles if personal and work activity should stay distinct
- Keep updates automatic
- Recheck key settings after major browser or OS updates

A concrete default is useful only if it survives ordinary routines.
If this feels tedious, remember the payoff profile: a browser default change quietly protects many daily actions with no extra clicks after setup.

## High-Risk Implementation
If you believe you are high-risk, prioritize ranking up quickly so stronger controls are in place sooner.

## Tooling Options
- Privacy-respecting browsers (Firefox, Brave)
- Lightweight blockers (uBlock Origin as an example)
- Browser profile or container features
- Sync features to keep settings aligned across devices

Prefer fewer tools used consistently over complex stacks.
Clarity beats customization at this rank.
Keep your setup intentionally boring.

## Common Mistakes
- Changing desktop browser but not mobile defaults
- Installing many privacy extensions and increasing fingerprint uniqueness
- Keeping old browser shortcuts in daily quick access
- Treating migration as finished and never rechecking settings

## Verification Checklist
- New browser is default on desktop and mobile
- Third-party cookies are disabled
- Extension count is intentionally low
- Old browser is no longer in your default daily flow
- Auto-update is active and verified

## When To Move To Next Rank
- You use your new default browser consistently
- Relapses are rare and intentional
- You can explain your key settings in plain language
- You are ready to change your default search behavior

## Dependencies
You do not need technical skills to do this rank. You only need 30-60 minutes and a willingness to change one concrete default. Rank 0 helps, but it is not required. If an old site only works in your old browser, consider an alternative site, or keep that browser as a rare backup, not your daily default.
If you use both personal and work devices, apply the same default logic to each one so your habits do not split. Consistency is what turns setup into protection.

## Maintenance Cadence
Daily: stay on your default browser path.  
Monthly: review extensions and key settings.  
Quarterly: confirm defaults on all devices after major updates.
After major life or workflow changes (new device, new job, shared household device), run a quick reset to confirm your default path still matches your intent.

## Incident Scenario
In Ironmarket, a mapmaker named Corin moves to a safer browser on his work laptop but leaves his old browser as default on his phone. Most of his real browsing still happens on mobile, so tracking barely changes. Weeks later he notices ad profiles and suggestion feeds are just as invasive as before. In real-world terms, this is a split-default failure. Corin fixes it by setting mobile defaults, removing legacy shortcuts, and treating old-browser access as a backup-only path for one legacy site. His exposure drops because behavior now matches policy across devices.
